This repository contain solution of Assignment1.
I have used Node.js as a backened language and HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Embedded Javascript Templating as a frontend.
Due to shorter time a completed following points:
 * You would need to create both backend & frontend for this application.
 * Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
 * UI element/component should have the following features
  * We should be able to see their registered name, avatar, etc on hovering over the
     avatar.
  * We should also be able to see who all have visited the page in the past and the
     last timestamp they visited the page
 * Show error page when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the page
