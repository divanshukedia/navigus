This repository contain solution of Assignment1.
I have used Node.js as a backened language and HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Embedded Javascript Templating as a frontend.
Due to shorter time a completed following points:
 1. You would need to create both backend & frontend for this application.
 2. Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
 3. UI element/component should have the following features
  1. We should be able to see their registered name, avatar, etc on hovering over the
     avatar.
  2. We should also be able to see who all have visited the page in the past and the
     last timestamp they visited the page
5. Show error page when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the page
